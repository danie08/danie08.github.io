Welcome to my personal page!

My name is Daniela and I am currently a PhD student in the Language and Dialogue Technologies ([LanD](https://land.fbk.eu/)) group at Fondazione Bruno Kessler ([FBK](Fondazione Bruno Kessler)) in Trento, Italy. My PhD in Information Engineering and Computer Science is focused on Natural Language Processing and Generation. I hold a bachelor and a master's degree in Digital Humanities from the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english), where I specialised in Language Technologies. My research centers on persona-based dialogue generation, exploring how dialogue agents can adapt to different speaker profiles to enhance conversational coherence and diversity.
